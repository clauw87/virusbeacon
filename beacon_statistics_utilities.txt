* Beacon Summary statistics main

- # variants in database

- # variant frequency per position > needle ()

splits> # variants:

- # by original repository

- # by geo location

- # by sex

- # by age pyramid

- # by variant effect

- # by molecular consequence

- # by annotation: region type: intergenic feature Class ORFs and proteins, feature IDs

- # by platform

- # by disease/ disease_stage/ disease_outcome


* Utilities
- Visualization as Jordi was saying of Freq of variants and these covariates: sex, geo loc, age (maybe some simple statistics analysis could be allowed/included such as PCA?) so user can spot if there could be some association of some variants with some covariates?
