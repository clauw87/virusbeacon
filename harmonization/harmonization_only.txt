# harmonization_rules_mapping_4

NOTE: Now that we are getting Nanopore data we should start showing the two objects run_platform and run_platform_model. Note that before we were showing only run_platform_model and the column name in Beacon UI is now PLATFORM, so we now need to change that column name to PLATFORM MODEL and add the new column PLATFORM to the UI table

NOTE: “valid values"are the only values that should be extracted/kept in database (since other values coming from tags in those cases are unrelated and should therefore not been shown. These cases are accompanied by statement “Rest of values in the column change to NULL (leave empty)”)

## RUN

1. run_platform

* **XML tags**
  * names(xml$EXPERIMENT_PACKAGE_SET$EXPERIMENT_PACKAGE$EXPERIMENT$PLATFORM)

* **Valid values**
  * all 

2. run_platform_model 

* **XML tags**
  * xml$EXPERIMENT_PACKAGE_SET$EXPERIMENT_PACKAGE$EXPERIMENT$PLATFORM$ILLUMINA$INSTRUMENT_MODEL[[1]]

* **Valid values**
  * all

* **Values to fix**
- paired values in txt lists run_platform_model.txt and run_platform_model_fixed.txt (also here, since they are few:)
  * "Illumina MiSeq"  ->  "MiSeq"  
  * "Illumina HiSeq 2500"  ->  "HiSeq 2500"  
  * "Illumina iSeq 100"     ->  "iSeq 100"  
  * "Illumina MiniSeq"   ->     "MiniSeq"  
  * "Illumina NovaSeq 6000" -> "NovaSeq 6000"


2. library_source 

* **XML tags**
  * xml$EXPERIMENT_PACKAGE_SET$EXPERIMENT_PACKAGE$EXPERIMENT$DESIGN$LIBRARY_DESCRIPTOR$LIBRARY_SOURCE


* **Valid values**
  * all


* **Values to fix**
  * all to lowercase
  * "  genome   " -> "genome"


## BIOSAMPLE 

1. biosample_type
* **XML tags**
  * tissue 
  * env_medium
  * isolation_source
  * host_tissue_sampled

* **Valid values**
- list in biosample_type.txt (also here since they are few:)
  * "Human BALF sample", 
  * "Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid", 
  * "bronchoalveolar lavage fluid(BALF)", 
  * "Oro-pharyngeal swab", 
  * "oropharyngeal swab",  
  * "nasopharynx",  
  * "swab" 
  * "respiratory nasopharyngeal sample" 
  * "Nasopharyngeal/throat swab"
  * "Combined nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab" 
  * "oral swab; nasal swab; tracheal wash" 
  * "Diagnostic Swab" 
  * "tracheal swab" 
  * "bronchoalveolar lavage"
  * "sputum"
  * "oralpharyngeal" 
  * "nasal swab"  
  * "oropharynx"
  * "Stool"

  Rest of values in the column change to NULL 

NOTE: now there are samples that are mixes, e.g "oral swab; nasal swab; tracheal wash”. In those cases we should label them as “mix"and also as their component values (“oro/naso-pharyngeal swab”, ”tracheal swab/wash“). That’s why they appear duplicated in more than one “values to harmonize"set.


* **Values to harmonize**
- paired values in txt lists in biosample_type.txt and biosample_type_fixed.txt



2. collection_date

* **XML tags**
  * collection_date 

* **Valid values**
  * all

 
* **Values to harmonize**
  * "%d-%B-%Y"
  * "%Y-%m"
  * "%Y"

  Harmonize all to “%Y-%m-%d”

e.g

  * "%d-%B-%Y" values 
    * "01-Mar-2020"
    * "19-MAR-2020"

    convert to “%Y-%m-%d"to get:
    * "2020-03-01"
    * "2020-03-19"


* **Value to fix**
  * "2019-01-19"->  "2020-01-19" 
  * "missing"  -> NULL
  * "not applicable"  -> NULL



## HOST/INDIVIDUAL

1. host_taxon_id 
 
* **XML tags**
  * host

* **Valid values**
  * "Homo sapiens"
  * "Human"                   
  * "human"  

  Rest of values in the column change to NULL 


* **Value to fix**
  * "Human" -> “Homo sapiens"
  * "human" -> “Homo sapiens"


2. geo_origin

* **XML tags**
  * geo_loc_name
  * country
  * `geographic location (country and/or sea)`       (combined)
  * `geographic location (region and locality)`       (combined)

(The last two are pairs country-region shown in different tags, so we could extract them in just one value as `geographic location (country and/or sea)`: `geographic location (region and locality)` so we get in just one value for example “United Kingdom: Scotland”)


* **Valid values**
  * all
     

* **Values to fix/ harmonize**
- paired values in txt lists geo_loc_name.txt and geo_loc_name_fixed.txt
- and these two after extracting the combined tags above:
  * United Kingdom: Scotland -> "Europe:United Kingdom:Scotland:-"
  * United Kingdom: England -> "Europe:United Kingdom:England:-"


3. host_age

* **XML tags**
  * age
  * host_age

* **Valid values**
  all

* **Values to fix** 
-paired values in txt lists host_age.txt and host_age_fixed.txt (here since they are a few:)
  * "missing"-> NULL
  * "4 years"-> 4 
  * "35 y"-> 35
  * "5 y"-> 5


4. host_disease

* **XML tags**
  * host_disease

* **Valid values**
  * "nCoV pneumonia"                                 
  * "COVID-19"                                                                                
  * "severe acute respiratory syndrome"   
  * "respiratory infection"           

  Rest of values in the column change to NULL 


4. host_sex

* **XML tags**
  * host_sex

* **Valid values**
  * "female"                                 
  * "male" 
  * "Female"                                 
  * "Male" 

 Rest of values in the column change to NULL 

* **Values to harmonize/fix**
  * "Female"-> "female"
  * "Male"-> "male"


## VIRUS

1. taxon_id

* **XML tags**
  * EXPERIMENT_PACKAGE_SET> EXPERIMENT_PACKAGE> SAMPLE> SAMPLE_NAME> TAXON_ID[[1]]
    
* **Valid values**
  * all

* **Values to harmonize/fix**
