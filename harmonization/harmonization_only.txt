# harmonization_rules_mapping_4

NOTE: Now that we are getting Nanopore data we should start showing the two objects run_platform and run_platform_model. Note that before we were showing only run_platform_model and the column name in Beacon UI is now PLATFORM, so we now need to change that column name to PLATFORM MODEL and add the new column PLATFORM to the UI table

NOTE: “valid values"are the only values that should be extracted/kept in database (since other values coming from tags in those cases are unrelated and should therefore not been shown. These cases are accompanied by statement “Rest of values in the column change to NULL (leave empty)”)

## RUN

1. run_platform
 
NOTE: dont extract or ignore this field for gisaid and genbank, because they are wrongly set in xml (because of template Mau used, but the info is not true!!!!)


* **XML tags**
  * names(xml$EXPERIMENT_PACKAGE_SET$EXPERIMENT_PACKAGE$EXPERIMENT$PLATFORM)

* **Valid values**
  * all 

2. run_platform_model

  * xml$EXPERIMENT_PACKAGE_SET$EXPERIMENT_PACKAGE$EXPERIMENT$PLATFORM$NANOPORE$INSTRUMENT_MODEL[[1]]
  * xml$EXPERIMENT_PACKAGE_SET$EXPERIMENT_PACKAGE$EXPERIMENT$PLATFORM$ION_TORRENT$INSTRUMENT_MODEL[[1]]

* **Valid values**
  * all

* **Values to fix**
- paired values in txt lists run_platform_model.txt and run_platform_model_fixed.txt (also here, since they are few:)

  * "Illumina iSeq 100"     ->  "iSeq 100"

* **XML tags**
  * tissue 
  * env_medium
  * isolation_source
  * host_tissue_sampled
  * isolation source host-associated
  * sample_type


* **Valid values**
- only values in list in biosample_type.txt (also here since they are few:)
  * "Human BALF sample"
  * "Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid" 
  * "bronchoalveolar lavage fluid(BALF)"
  * "Oro-pharyngeal swab"
  * "oropharyngeal swab"  
  * "nasopharynx"
  * "swab" 
  * "respiratory nasopharyngeal sample" 
  * "Nasopharyngeal/throat swab"
  * "Combined nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab"

  * "oral swab; nasal swab; tracheal wash"

  * "Nasopharingeal exudate" 
  * "Pharyngeal exudate"    
  * "Nasopharyngeal exudate"

  Rest of values in the column change to NULL 

* **Values to harmonize**
- paired values in txt lists in biosample_type.txt and biosample_type_fixed.txt

NOTE: last value, "oral swab; nasal swab; tracheal wash" is converted to two values, I have separated them by commas in on single string in biosample_type_fixed.txt


2. collection_date

* **XML tags**
  * collection_date 
  * collection date

* **Valid values**
  * all

 
* **Values to harmonize**
  * "%d-%B-%Y"
  * "%Y-%m"
  * "%Y"

  Harmonize all to “%Y-%m-%d”

e.g

  * "%d-%B-%Y" values 
    * "01-Mar-2020"
    * "19-MAR-2020"


    convert to “%Y-%m-%d"to get:
    * "2020-03-01"
    * "2020-03-19"


* **Value to fix**
  * "2019-01-19"->  "2020-01-19" 
  * "Jan-2020" -> "2020-01"
  * "feb-2020")] <- "2020-02"
  * "Apr-2020" <- "2020-04"


  * "missing"  -> NULL
  * "not applicable"  -> NULL
  * "NA" -> NULL



## HOST/INDIVIDUAL

1. host_taxon_id 
 
* **XML tags**
  * host

* **Valid values**
  * "Homo sapiens"
  * "Human"                   
  * "human"  

  Rest of values in the column change to NULL 


* **Value to fix**
  * "Human" -> “Homo sapiens"
  * "human" -> “Homo sapiens"


2. geo_origin

* **XML tags**
  * geo_loc_name
  * country
  * Country
  * `geographic location (country and/or sea)`       (combined)
  * `geographic location (region and locality)`       (combined)

(The last two are pairs country-region that are split in the two different tags but are meant together, so we should extract them in just one value as `geographic location (country and/or sea)`:`geographic location (region and locality)` so we get in just one value for example “United Kingdom:Scotland”). Assuming you extract them in this form, Include these values and their harmonized form in the paired values lists. NOTE: In some cases the second tag is not present (Denkmark), I added both in list in case you extract them as “Denkmark” only or as “Denkmark:”


* **Valid values**
* all
     

* **Values to fix/ harmonize**
- paired values in txt lists geo_loc_name.txt and geo_loc_name_fixed.txt
- and these two after extracting the combined tags above: (NO, NOW THEY ARE IN LISTS)
  * United Kingdom: Scotland -> "Europe:United Kingdom:Scotland:-"
  * United Kingdom: England -> "Europe:United Kingdom:England:-"
- "not applicable" -> NULL
- "not collected" -> NULL
- "not collected:not collected" -> NULL
