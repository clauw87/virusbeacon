As a result of exploration of the 439 xmls coming from sra (comparing to first 50).

- Only 1 new sample attribute tag was found that was not on any of the 50 previously checked, host_tissue_sampled, found only in 18 samples. This tag needs to be extracted.

- Additional xmls have info more or less with the same proportion as the 50 first ones on all the most commonly used of the previously 31 sample attributes tags and were now added to the graphs. > sra_sample_atributes.pdf. 

- All other tags were the same and similarly populated in the 439 xmls as in the 50 previously checked.


Distribution of some sample attribute values such as sex and age are in sra_sample_grid.pdf

Distribution of some experiment attribute values such as platform model and library source are in sra_experiment_grid.pdf
